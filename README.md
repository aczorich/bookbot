BookBot is my first project.

It takes the text of Frankenstein in .txt format and does the following:

Extracts the words from the .txt file.
Counts the number of words in the .txt file.
Counts the number of alpha characters in the .txt file.

Prints a report of: (1) the number of words; and (2) the number of 
each unique character.
